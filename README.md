# tcr.js
This project aims to provide a convenient js library for experimenting with
token-curated registries and using them in dapps. The initial focus is to act as
a wrapper for Mike Goldin's [tcr](https://github.com/skmgoldin/tcr), but the long-term plan is
to enable a modular approach to creating tcrs, for example ordered or nested tcrs, swappable voting machines, data storage
strategies.
